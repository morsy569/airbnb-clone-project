Since the system handles sensitive information such as user credentials, payment data, and booking details, implementing strong security measures is essential to ensure data integrity, confidentiality, and trust.

---

### 🧩 Key Security Measures

#### 🔑 Authentication

The project uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for user authentication to verify user identity during API requests. Each user must log in to receive a token, which is then included in subsequent requests to access protected endpoints.
**Importance:** Prevents unauthorized users from accessing private data and ensures only verified users can perform specific actions.

---

#### 🛡️ Authorization

Role-based access control (RBAC) is implemented to define what actions a user can perform based on their role (e.g., host, guest, or admin). For instance, only hosts can add or modify property listings, while guests can make bookings.
**Importance:** Protects system integrity by ensuring users only have access to actions and data relevant to their role.

---

#### 🚦 Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is used to restrict the number of API requests a user or IP address can make in a given timeframe. This prevents abuse of the system and protects against **Denial of Service (DoS)** and **brute-force attacks**.
**Importance:** Ensures the backend remains available and stable, even under heavy traffic or malicious use.

---

#### 🔒 Data Encryption

Sensitive data, such as passwords and payment information, is encrypted both **in transit** (via HTTPS using SSL/TLS) and **at rest** (using encryption algorithms like AES).
**Importance:** Protects confidential user information from being intercepted or exposed during communication or data breaches.

---

#### 🧠 Input Validation & Sanitization

All user inputs are validated and sanitized to prevent common web vulnerabilities such as **SQL Injection**, **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**, and **Command Injection**.
**Importance:** Maintains backend integrity and prevents attackers from manipulating database queries or executing malicious code.

---

#### 🧰 Secure API Endpoints

Endpoints are protected using authentication middleware, and unnecessary data exposure (such as user passwords or internal IDs) is avoided. Additionally, error messages are generalized to prevent revealing sensitive system details.
**Importance:** Prevents attackers from gathering information about the system’s internal logic or structure.

---

#### 💳 Payment Security

The system integrates with trusted payment gateways that comply with **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**. No sensitive card details are stored directly in the system’s database.
**Importance:** Ensures safe and compliant handling of financial transactions, protecting both users and the platform from fraud.

---

#### 🧩 Logging & Monitoring

All critical actions (logins, payments, and data updates) are logged and monitored for unusual activity. Alerts are triggered for suspicious behaviors such as multiple failed login attempts.
**Importance:** Helps detect, prevent, and respond quickly to potential security threats.
